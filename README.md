Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The run_analysis.R script assumes package reshape2 to be installed already.

To run the file the following files should be in the working directory together with the run_analysis.R file:

activity_labels.txt
subject_test.txt
subject_train.txt
X_test.txt
X_train.txt
y_test.txt
y_train.txt

Execute the script from RStudio or from the R command line using source("run_analysis.R").

A file called tidyData.txt will be generated in the working directory.

The code book for the generated set of tidy data can be found in CodeBook.md
